# MM CMS Client

<br />

<!-- - **Flux** is used for state management and all Flux specific files are located inside `src/flux`. Transitioning to a more robust solution such as Redux is also fairly simple.
- The `src/components` directory hosts all template-specific subcomponents in their own subdirectory.
- The layout styles inherited from Shards Dashboard are pulled in from the `src/shards-dashboard` submodule inside `src/App.js`.
- The `src/utils` directory contains generic Chart.js utilities. -->
